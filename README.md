# Intellignosis
This branch contains the machine learning components of the project. 
Intellignosis uses the k-Nearest Neighbour algorithm for both classification and regression components of the project. 
Initially, patients will be classified as healthy and MDD according to the differences in their EEG signals. 
Then the MDD patients will be classified into 4 categories (minimal, mild, moderate and severe) based on the Beck Depression Inventory Index.
