## How to Install

An installer will be implemented where it will contain a setup where within a few clicks of a button the application could be installed.(Github releases)
1. [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/). We prefer sticking to the latest version.
2. [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Again, we prefer the latest version.
3. [PIP](https://pypi.org/project/pip/)Needed to download a bunch of dependancies for python
4. [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) Used for the application

After all the depeendencies are installed open two command prompts for the two servers and run

`npm run flask`

and in the other one

`npm run devStart`

After these steps open Local host 3000 OR open the intellignosis application 
   
OR

Use our website (https://intellignosis.herokuapp.com/)(NOT ACESSIBLE AS THE HOSTING SITE IS DOWN)
